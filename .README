# Buggy speech recognition

This is an example of speech recognition but for some reason it doesn't work.

## Error:

When the file is executed it shows the following message:

```
/home/kennio/dev/katia/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/models/wav2vec2/tokenization_wav2vec2.py:417: FutureWarning: The class `Wav2Vec2Tokenizer` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of Transformers. Please use `Wav2Vec2Processor` or `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer` instead.
  warnings.warn(

Then the console get closed. 

## Steps to reproduce the behavior:

### Install Dependencies
